# Intro
Welcome!

citepro is a collection of wrapper codes that is aimed to provide streamlined data processing experience to convert Multiomic RNA+Protein cellranger count matrix to h5ad, a data container format that is compatible with downstream analysis code written in python or R  
 
citepro is built on the popular and well known python packages in the [scverse](https://scverse.org/) ecosystem, such as the following:

 * [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), the ***de facto*** analysis tool suite for single cell data analysis.

 * [anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), the annotated data matrices container format.

 * [muon](https://muon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), multiomic data container format the is built on top of anndata.

 * [celltypist](https://www.celltypist.org/), an automated cell type annotating tool that use RNA signature to predict the celltypes \(such as T or B cells\). 

!!! note

    The citepro is under active development, and codes may be changing frequently.
